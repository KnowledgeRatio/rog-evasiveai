### Step 2: Download This Tool
1. Download all files from this repository to a folder on your computer
2. Remember where you saved them!

### Step 3: Install Required Components
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the files
3. Type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Press Enter and wait for it to finish

### Step 4: Run the Scraper
1. In the same Command Prompt/Terminal, type: `python meta_scraper_updated.py`
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for it to finish (takes about 2-3 minutes)
4. You'll see progress updates as it downloads each section

## What You'll Find in Your Results

After the scraper finishes, you'll have a new folder called `meta_standards_output` with these files:

### üìä Summary Files
- **`summary.txt`** - Your main report! Shows what was downloaded successfully
- **`meta_standards_summary.json`** - Technical version (you can ignore this)

### üìÑ Content Files
- **`00_main_page.txt`** - Meta's main Community Standards page
- **`01_Coordinating_Harm_and_Promoting_Crime.txt`** - First policy section
- **`02_Dangerous_Organisations_and_Individuals.txt`** - Second policy section
- ...and so on through **`27_User_Requests.txt`**

### üîç How to Read Your Results

1. **Start with `summary.txt`** - This tells you:
   - How many sections were downloaded successfully
   - Which sections (if any) failed to download
   - Success rate percentage

2. **Browse the numbered files** - Each contains:
   - The full text of one policy section
   - The official title from Meta's website
   - The web address where it came from
   - How many characters of content were captured

### üìà Understanding the Summary Report

When you open `summary.txt`, you'll see something like:

```
META COMMUNITY STANDARDS SCRAPING SUMMARY
============================================================

Total sections attempted: 27
Successfully scraped: 27
Failed: 0
Success rate: 100.0%

SUCCESSFUL SECTIONS:
------------------------------
‚úì Coordinating Harm and Promoting Crime (13,344 chars)
‚úì Dangerous Organisations and Individuals (24,009 chars)
...
```

- **Total sections attempted**: How many policy sections the tool tried to download
- **Successfully scraped**: How many actually worked
- **Success rate**: Percentage that worked (100% is perfect!)
- **Character count**: Shows how much content was captured (more = better)

## Troubleshooting (If Something Goes Wrong)

### ‚ùå "Python is not recognized" Error
**Problem**: Python isn't installed properly
**Solution**: 
1. Reinstall Python from python.org
2. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your computer

### ‚ùå "pip is not recognized" Error  
**Problem**: Python package manager isn't working
**Solution**: Try `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead

### ‚ùå Some Sections Show "Failed to scrape"
**Problem**: Meta might have changed their website
**Solution**: This is normal - the tool will get most sections even if a few fail

### ‚ùå Very Slow or Stuck
**Problem**: The tool waits 2 seconds between downloads to be respectful
**Solution**: This is normal! Just wait - it takes 2-3 minutes total

### ‚ùå Empty or Very Short Files
**Problem**: Meta's website might be temporarily down or changed
**Solution**: Try running the tool again later

## For Advanced Users

- Uses `requests` library for web downloads
- Uses `BeautifulSoup` for reading website content
